# co2-tracker
For project 2 of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive, I plan to build a carbon emissions tracker app which allows users to track the carbon emissions associated with their use of transport and household energy.


### Structure of web app
The app will comprise the following pages / features:
* User sign up page 
* Ability to add new emissions 'events' 
* Ability to edit / delete previously entered data 
* Ability to use pre-loaded emission rates, or to manually enter own emissions rates 
* Ability to view a simple dashboard summary of results 


### User stories 
As a user, I want to:
* Quickly enter data, even if I don't know the specific emissions rate 
* Get some insights into my carbon emissions 


### Technology used
* Web server: Python flask
* Database: postgresql 
* Front end: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Google Charts


### Technical aspects
* Object oriented programming approach - used Emission class with methods get_units() and get_date(), User class for app users
